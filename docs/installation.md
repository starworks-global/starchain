# Installation

## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (maximum version is 1.19.13) and a C compiler. You can install them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Prerequisites

- Go (maximum version is 1.19.13)
- C compiler
- Git for version control

Install these dependencies using your operating system's package manager before proceeding with the build process.
